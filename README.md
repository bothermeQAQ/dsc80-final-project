# Do LCK games really last longer?

## Project Overview

This project uses the **2018 League of Legends professional match dataset** from Oracle’s Elixir.  
Each row corresponds to either a team or a player in a professional match and includes
detailed in-game and post-game statistics.

The main question I investigate is:

> **Do different professional leagues play significantly longer games,  
> or are game lengths roughly the same across regions?**

In particular, I compare **LCK** (Korea) to other major leagues (LPL, LCS, LEC), and build
a prediction model that tries to predict which team will win based on early-game
statistics (gold, XP, CS, kills, etc. at 10 minutes).
